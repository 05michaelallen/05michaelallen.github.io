My name is Michael Allen. I am a PhD student in the Department of Geography at <a href="http://geog.ucsb.edu" target="_blank">UCSB</a>, working under the advisement of Dr. Joseph P. McFadden. I work primarily on remote sensing of urban climates, with particular focus on the importance of the surface in determining human thermal comfort, energy usage, at a variety of scales. In 2017 I completed a MSc in Physical Geography at the University of Western Ontario. My <a href="http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/4594/" target="_blank">thesis</a> work, written under the advisement of Dr. James A. Voogt, develops a method to derive 3-dimensional urban surface temperature and provides the first time-contious, geometrically representative analysis of the surface urban heat island effect.
